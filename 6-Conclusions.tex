    \begin{itemize}
        \item LightNeuron is another example that Turla operators
        have a large set of sophisticated, custom malware at their disposal
        \item This is the first time a malicious actor has leveraged a Microsoft Exchange Transport
        Agent to enable persistence on a mail server
        \item This technique is very interesting as it allows them to receive
        commands and exfiltrate data without any filtering.
        \item Probably not many servers have been infected in this manner, but itâ€™s certainly wise to review Exchange server configurations to look for any unexplained transport agent.

Beamer [presentation](./main.pdf) on Turla LightNeuron for ICT Risk Assessment Course @ MD CS Unipi

Turla, also known as Snake, is one of oldest, still-active cyberespionage groups, with more than a decade
of experience. Its operators mainly focus on high-profile targets such as governments and diplomatic
entities in Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.
To perform these operations, Turlaâ€™s operators own a large arsenal of malware including a rootkit,
several complex backdoors (with a notable one for Microsoft Outlook), and a large range of tools to pivot
on a network.

This presentation is based on a [paper](https://cdn1.esetstatic.com/ESET/US/resources/white-papers/ESET_Lightneuron_WP.pdf) about LightNeuron, a backdoor specifically designed to target
Microsoft Exchange mail servers.
